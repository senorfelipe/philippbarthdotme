<p>
  I am a Software Engineer from Germany focused on Fullstack Development with a
  heart for backend development in the <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b> world.
</p>
<p>
  My intention with this page is to <b>represent</b> some of the work I have
  done already, <b>share</b> some expieriences while coding and to give some
  insights on my thoughts through my <b>blog</b>. And next to that I almost felt
  the obligation as a programmer to have some sort of personal website.
