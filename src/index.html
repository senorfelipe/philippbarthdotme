<p>
  I am a Software Engineer focused on Fullstack Development in the Java and
  python world. My intention with this page is to represent some of the work I
  have done already and to give a little impression of who I am. And next to
  that I almost felt the obligation as a programmer to have a personal site.

  I studied Business Informatics at
  <a href="https://htw-dresden.de/">HTW Dresden</a>. Currently I live in Leipzig
  and work as a freelancer while exploring some other potential carerr paths.
