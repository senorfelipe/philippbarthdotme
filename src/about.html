<h4>My Career in a nutshell</h4>
<p>
  I studied Business Informatics at
  <a href="https://htw-dresden.de/">HTW Dresden</a>. After my bachelor degree I
  started working in a startup in Dresden as a Software Developer. As I was part
  of a small team, and had great mentorship from my colleagues I quickly learned
  the basics of Software Development and had fun contributong to a big variety
  of projects. I enjoyed the hands-on expierience and deepening my knowledge in
  line with the motto "learning by doing".
</p>
<p>
  In 2023 I left the company and went travelling to South America. After I came
  back I had the wish to try my luck as a freelancer and found a nice company to
  work for. Right now I live in Leipzig and I am looking for a new professional
  challange. If you are interested workwise you can take a look at my
  <a href="/vitae">resume</a> or contact me directly

<h4>Other more or less interesting things</h4>
<p>
  I am a fan of various sports and moving the body in general. I like martial arts, going to the gym, trying out calistanics and occasionally climb walls. In winter
  I love to be in the mountains and ski or snowboard.
  Furthermore I enjoy music a lot. Especially electronic music, I am playing around with some DJ stuff and would love to further explore this carft. And since 
  some time I am practicing the Baritone.
